# Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)
Question: Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string. In fact, the word if and the character ? are not allowed in your code.

PseudoCode: 
1. Define a function that will compare the numbers, and take two parameters a (the first number) and b (second number)
2. The spaceship operator (<=>) is used to compare a and b. It returns 2 if a is greater than b, 1 if a is smaller than b, and 0 if a is equal to b.
3. The results are stored in the comparison variable.
4. Will use the case-when statement to handle values of comparison. The output will be '2' if a is bigger than b, '1' if a is smaller than b, and '0' if a equals to b. 

Code:
